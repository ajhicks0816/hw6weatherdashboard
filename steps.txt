1. create click event for search button (add a console.log("clicked!!") before anything else to make sure it works)
2. make ajax call in click event and console.log the response
3. use the response to take the properties we want to display to our user and create / update our HTML (the DOM) with that information
4. try generating the html for our "history" list dynamically (using nothing but javascript) after we click the "search" button
