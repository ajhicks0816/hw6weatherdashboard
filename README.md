# hw6weatherdashboard

## Description
Make a weather dashboard that provides weather for the city entered once the search button is clicked. Once the city is searched it will render an output that will provide current weather details about that specific day including city name, date, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, along with a 5 day forecast.

## Challenges
Starting early on this homework assignment provided me the time to work through the assignment. To build the foundation, process it and learn as I continued through. As I continue to progress I learn new things that allow me to feel more confident in my skill set. I still struggle with remembering how to write out the actual code but I have the idea which helps when researching how to do something.
